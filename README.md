Kobretti ZSH theme
=================

A customised version of the built-in [Pygmalion oh-my-zsh theme](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/blob/master/themes/pygmalion.zsh-theme).

What's different?
-----------------

- $ instead if % prompt,
- minor optimisation of the no-colours regex,
- increased the threshold of the number of characters in the prompt before  if jumps to a new line,
- improved code readability by splitting the prompt code into separate lines.

Installation
------------

1. Drop the file under `~/.oh-my-zsh/themes/`
2. Configure the theme in your `.zshrc` file:
    ```
    ZSH_THEME="kobretti"
    ```
